# Credit Risk Model Optimization

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop and optimize a credit risk model using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The model leverages various borrower features to help financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions.

## Key Features:
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and scaling the dataset.
- **Modeling**: Applying algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.

## Files in This Repository:
- **crm-code.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook for data processing, model building, and evaluation.
- **case_study1.xlsx** & **case_study2.xlsx**: Datasets for credit risk modeling.
- **Features_Target_Description.xlsx**: Descriptions of dataset features.


## Usage

1. **Load Data**: Use the `case_study1.xlsx` or `case_study2.xlsx` dataset.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and scale the data.
3. **Train & Evaluate**: Apply machine learning models and evaluate their performance.



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to optimize credit risk models, helping financial institutions make more informed lending decisions.
